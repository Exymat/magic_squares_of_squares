## Introduction

This repository is focused on 3x3 magic squares of positive squared integers, with 9 distinct values.

We define $N$ as the sum of all row, column, and diagonal sums in the magic square. For example, $N = aÂ²+bÂ²+cÂ²$, and so on for all axes.

We name "quasi-magic-squares" squares where the sum of all but 1 axis are equal.

For example, this is a quasi magic square of squares (all of these integers are perfect squares):

We aim to:
1. Find as many "quasi-magic-squares" as possible, and if possible find a real 3x3 magic square of squares ;
2. Empirically show that all "quasi-magic-squares" are under the following form:

$$
N = (3 k p^2)^2, \quad \text{where } k \in \mathbb{N}^+ \text{ and } p \text{ is a prime such that } p \equiv 1 \pmod{6}.
$$


## List of tested values of $N$ with no perfect magic square

We tested up to $N = 10000000$ (10 million) and found no perfect magic square. However we found 30 quasi magic squares, with the smallest one at $N=21609$ and the biggest one at $N=9529569$.

[The entire list can be found here](https://github.com/TheMrZZ/magic_squares_of_squares/blob/main/quasi_magic_squares_list_10million.txt).

## "Smallest" quasi-magic-square found

Here's the smallest quasi-magic-square of squares we found:
|     |      |      |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| 74Â² | 127Â² | 2Â²   |
| 97Â² | 58Â²  | 94Â²  |
| 82Â² | 46Â²  | 113Â² |

All rows, columns, and diagonal sums are equal to $21609$ except for the bottom-left to top-right diagonal which is equal to $10092$.

## Conjecture on quasi magic squares

1. We conjecture that all quasi magic squares have $N$ such as

$$
N = (3 k p^2)^2, \quad \text{where } k \in \mathbb{N}^+ \text{ and } p \text{ is a prime such that } p \equiv 1 \pmod{6}.
$$

2. We also conjecture that any $N$ of this form is a quasi magic square.

*Note: The list of first 54 primes of form 6n+1 can be found in [OEIS A002476](https://oeis.org/A002476).*

ðŸ‘‰ Conjecture #1 has been tested up to N = 10 million: [see here](https://github.com/TheMrZZ/magic_squares_of_squares/blob/main/quasi_magic_squares_list_10million.txt).

ðŸ‘‰ Conjecture #2 has been tested up to $k=10$ for all primes of form 6n+1 from $7$ to $199$ (21 different primes): [see here](https://github.com/TheMrZZ/magic_squares_of_squares/blob/main/quasi_magic_squares_k10_p199.txt).


**We have no idea *why* this conjecture works**, but we've tested it empirically on large numbers. Our only guess concerns the `3Â²` which we assume is related to the size of the magic square (`3x3`).

## "Largest" quasi magic square found

The above conjecture allows us to generate quasi magic squares with arbitrarily large $N$. The biggest we generated was $N = 46 432 503 939 600$ (46 trillion 432 billion) with $k=10$ and $p=199$:
|          |          |          |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 3751060Â² | 5653160Â² | 635480Â²  |
| 4510760Â² | 2491880Â² | 4458260Â² |
| 3466280Â² | 2874860Â² | 5113960Â² |

All rows, columns and diagonal sums are equal to $N$ except for the bottom-left to top-right diagonal which is equal to $18 628 397 803 200$ (18 trillion 628 billion).

## How to try

To run the code in this repository, you must [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). You can then run different commands:
```sh
Usage:
    cargo test_n <n_min> <n_max>  # Test all N in the range [n_min, n_max)
    cargo test_kp <max_k> <max_p> # Test all N in the form of (k*3*pÂ²)Â² with k in [1, max_k] and p prime in [1, max_p]
    cargo generate <k> <p>        # Generate a large quasi magic square in the form of (k*3*pÂ²)Â²
```

*For all arguments, underscores are supported as separators for large numbers, but they're not required.*

### Testing ranges of $N$

To check ranges of $N$ for the presence of quasi magic squares (or perfect magic squares, who knows!), you can run:

```sh
cargo test_n 1 100_000 # Checks all N from 1 to 100k
```

<details>
  <summary>Example output</summary>

  <div>

  ```
  > cargo test_n 1 100_000

  âœ… N is in the form of (k*3*pÂ²)Â² with p=7 and k=1

  a = 148, b = 254, c = 4, d = 194, e = 116, f = 188, g = 164, h = 92, i = 226
  âœ… N is in the form of (k*3*pÂ²)Â² with p=7 and k=2
  Time: 0.04 seconds
  ```

</details>


### Testing ranges of $k$ and $p$

To ensure our conjecture works for all $k$ and $p$ in a range, you can run:

```sh
cargo test_kp 5 43 # Checks all k from 1 to 5 and all prime p of form 6n+1 from 7 to 43
```

### Generating a very large quasi magic square

To generate a large quasi magic square, you can pick 2 values of k and p then run:
```sh
cargo generate 5 73 # Generate the quasi magic square with k=10 and p=169
```

## How it works

We'll name our cells like this:
|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aÂ²  | bÂ²  | cÂ²  |
| dÂ²  | eÂ²  | fÂ²  |
| gÂ²  | hÂ²  | iÂ²  |

1. For a given $N$, we generate all possible values of `e` from 1 to $\sqrt{N}$.

2. For each `e`, we compute $X=N-e^2$. We then generate all pairs of integers such as $x^2 + y^2 = X, x != y$. 
These pairs will be the candidates for all axes going through the center, except one which is left free (to allow for quasi-perfect squares). 
Therefore, if we have less than 3 distinct pairs of $(x, y)$, we don't proceed further (as we're looking for magic squares of distinct values).

3. We will now test all permutations of these candidates in the 3 axes $a \longleftrightarrow i$, $d \longleftrightarrow f$, $b \longleftrightarrow h$. We know (by construction) that the sum of their squares is equal to $N$.

4. We already have 3 correct axes out of 8, and 7 cells out of 9. We will now generate `c` and `g` through $c^2 = N - a^2 - b^2$ and $g^2 = N - h^2 - i^2$.
If these equations don't yield integers, we stop there as it means the current permutation is not a solution.

5. At this point, we know the $a \longleftrightarrow c$ and $g \longleftrightarrow i$ axes are correct (sum of their squares is equal to $N$), and we have all our values. We make sure they're all distinct values.

6. Finally, we check the remaining 3 axes $g \longleftrightarrow c$, $c \longleftrightarrow i$ and $a \longleftrightarrow g$.

7. If 7/8 axes are correct, we found a quasi-perfect square. If 8/8 axes are correct, we found a perfect square. Our program is designed to instantly interrupt its operation in that case, panic and send a big message.

## Optimizations

Here's a list of some optimizations we made to crunch numbers as fast as possible:
1. Avoid generating symmetrical permutations of the same magic square (ex: symmetry by a diagonal, rotation by 90Â°... as they give the same square)
2. Use Rust and not Python
3. Pre-compute pairs of $(x, y)$ such as $x^2+y^2=X$ for all $0 <= X <= N$
4. Remove as much overhead as possible in Rust objects (avoid using `Vec`, use `FxHashMap` instead of the native `HashMap`)
5. Use multiprocessing to compute batches of `N` in parallel

## Benchmarks

These tests were performed on an AMD 5600X processor with 6x2 cores. They all leverage parallelism. They're probably not very reproductible, but they give a good idea of how the processing time scales based on inputs.

| Test                                        | Time (s) |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Check all $N$ from 1 to 100k                | 0.04s    |
| Check all $N$ from 1 to 1 million           | 2.32s    |
| Check all $N$ from 1 to 10 million          | 132s     |
| Check all $(k, p)$ with $k <= 5, p <= 19$   | 0.01s    |
| Check all $(k, p)$ with $k <= 10, p <= 73$  | 9.07s    |
